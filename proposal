Overview:
For this project, I will create a netflix recommendation engine. I hope to have a final product that allows users to perform a search
using a title of a movie or show, and receive recommendations for similar content. 

Data:
- https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

Tools:
- I will probably use NLTK, Spacy, tf-idf, k-means ...the rest is TBD

MVP: 
- A basic recommendation system with *at least* vaguely relevant search results
