Overview:
For this project, I will create an artwork recommendation engine. I hope to have a final product that allows users to perform a search
using terms like "acrylic" or "surrealism" and receive results (results will be specific paintings from ArtFinder.com) based on the search terms.

Data:
- I will scrape data from ArtFinder.com -- specifically: hashtags, descriptions, sizes, and prices for individual paintings

Tools:
- I will probably use NLTK, Spacy, tf-idf, k-means ...the rest is TBD

MVP:
- an MVP should be at least a visualization that is able to describe, in some way, similarities between various works of art? Some sort of foundation from which 
the actual recommendation system can be built
